# Backend API for Ecommerce 

The primary objective of this project is to streamline the development process of an e-commerce platform by providing a well-structured and feature-rich backend API. Whether you're building a small boutique store or a large-scale marketplace, this project serves as an excellent starting point that can be customized to meet your specific business requirements.

Features
1. Get Latest Products : 
The API provides endpoints to retrieve the latest products in the store. By accessing these endpoints, you can efficiently showcase new products on your website or mobile app, keeping your customers informed about your freshest offerings.

2. Search :
Efficient and accurate search functionality is crucial for any successful e-commerce platform. This backend API integrates powerful search capabilities, allowing users to find products based on various criteria, such as name, category, and more.

3. Payment Integration using Stripe : 
Smooth payment processing is essential for a seamless shopping experience. The API integrates with the popular payment gateway Stripe, enabling customers to make secure payments using various payment methods, including credit/debit cards and digital wallets.

4. Customer Order History : 
Customers can access their order history through dedicated endpoints. This feature enhances the user experience, allowing them to view their past orders, track shipments, and review order details. With this functionality, customers can conveniently keep track of their purchases and reorder items easily.

5. Authentication (Login and Register) :
Security is paramount when dealing with customer data. For this project, the authentication system is developed using Djoser, a powerful and customizable authentication library for Django. Djoser provides endpoints for user registration, login, password reset, and more, ensuring a secure authentication process.
